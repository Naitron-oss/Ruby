Ruby Wars
=========

This is a Ruby implementation of [Castlewars](http://www.kongregate.com/games/m0rkeulv/castlewars) that I started over 
the weekend.  I've been learning Ruby lately, and within the last few weeks I've started learning more about WEBrick, 
Rack, and Heroku so I'd like to get an App published.  I enjoy Castlewars, find it surprisingly addicting for such a 
simple game, and thought I would take a crack at Ruby-izing it.

There's no UI implemented yet, so it's un-playable.  However, I will try to get that started this week a little and might
have a working model by next weekend.  I'd like to switch up the branding/styling a little to be a popularity contest rather
than a medieval battle.  I'm imagining you and your rival competing for the favor of girls, teachers, and coolness.
You can beat down your opponent or grow to fame first.

Also, there's no AI implemented yet.  I'd like to come up with a prioritization scheme.  Since this is a turn based game,
the computer could look at how close it is to victory in either direction and the cards that it has to order its cards and
decide if it should discard, rather than play.

Fun!
